Devel::Isa::Explainer

This module is a simple tool for quickly visualizing inheritance
hierarchies to quickly see what functions are available for a given
class, or to ascertain where a given function you might see in use is
coming from.

This module does not concern itself with any of the fanciness of Roles,
and instead, relies entirely on standard Perl5 Object Model
infrastructure. ( Roles are effectively invisible at run-time as they
appear as composed functions in the corresponding class )
