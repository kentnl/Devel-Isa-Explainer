0.002900 2016-06-26T19:35:43Z 7405ed0
 - UNIVERSAL now automatically shown in inheritance. ( Closes #11 )
 - discovering subs using "can" now removed, as "can" was prematurely exposing subs in crossed inheritances, which
   leads to over-zealous de-duplication, and additional appearances of shadowing where no actual shadowing was
   happening. ( #10 )
 - blessed coderefs no longer misunderstood.
 - deduplicating subs now entirely removed, subs that are actually there in the package must always be displayed as
   they are either injected by roles or importing, and can actually end up calling themselves under inheritance. ( This
   however is highly prone to explosions because MRO core sucks ) ( Related to #10 )
 - isa-splain now supports --help and --version ( Closes #9 )

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 0.002001, see misc/*.deps* for details
 - runtime: +2 -1
 - test: +1

 [Documentation]
 - Improve bin/isa-splain's documentation to be more helpful in places where `man isa-splain` might be expected to
   work.

 [Internals]
 - Highligher functions now receive all sub metadata directly as a hash, instead of being called with a list of binary
   flags.
 - Parents of classes now recorded in internal data structures, but not yet exposed.
 - MRO type of classes now recorded in internal data structures.
 - XSUB, Constant and stub-subs marked in internal data structures.

 [Documentation]
 - Reference updated screenshots.

 [Internals]
 - use namespace::clean in a few more places.

0.002000 2016-05-19T12:30:00Z 6c368ff
 - isa-splain now accepts -M parameter to explicitly specify modules to load. This is helpful in handling cases where
   one module inlines others, ( B -> B::CV ) or a module can't be loaded on its own ( Class::MOP::Class )

 [Bug #6]
 - Poking MAX_WIDTH to a value smaller than 5 no longer triggers an infinite loop, instead, a minimum of one package
   per line will be emitted, even if it exceeds MAX_WIDTH.

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 0.001001, see misc/*.deps* for details
 - develop: +1
 - runtime: +1

 [Internals]
 - factored out _class_subs function
 - Method Resolution mechanics reworked to more closely reflect how perl-itself views methods. This will reduce certain
   redundant duplicate coderefs and only show them at the lowest point in the heirachy where they are defined.
 - Now fatals when inheritance lookup returns nothing and the package had a compile failure.

0.001001 2016-04-01T09:31:35Z ab66fba

0.001000 2016-03-31T13:55:56Z 3c0283f
